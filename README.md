Data from Planet Labs **(3m/5m resolution)** is optimal for small-scale and epidemiological use cases, however data bottlenecking (finding the ideal cloud-free haze-free scene, then downloading for a large temporal window) creates barriers to easy analysis. **Epicyclic**, in tandem with ***planknit***, seeks to create better PS/REScenes spatiotemporal capturing, delivery, and integrate cleanly into the Google Earth Engine and Cloud Storage ecosystems for rapid processing and analysis.
